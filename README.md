# Sharty Archiver

This project is an attempt to implement a fully working archiving program for the [Soyjak Party](soyjak.st) website.

# Goals

This is a very rough prototype and it only supports archiving the images of a thread.

I will need to implement the following later:

1. Implement the archival of full threads with both media and text.
1. Add a very simple archive viewer.
